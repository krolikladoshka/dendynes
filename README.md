# dendynes emulator
a project I always wanted to implement & to refresh rust knowledge

* Has sprite rendering bug (overlapping from neighbouring nametable)
* Works ridiculously slow in dev mod
* Works just fine in release mode, but even faster than expected
* Sometimes cpu cycles count overflows causing an infinity loop
* Poor logging & No Tests Programming (NTP)
